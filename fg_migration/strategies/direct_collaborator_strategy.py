class DirectCollaboratorOnlyStrategy(BaseAccessMappingStrategy):
    """
        Strategy that bypasses all access-level team modelling and assigns
        repository access directly to users.

        This strategy treats repository memberships as the canonical representation
        of authorization and does not attempt to group users into Forgejo teams.
        Each repository accessor is imported as an individual collaborator with the
        closest matching Forgejo permission.

        Example
        -------
        Given source-system membership data:

            alice   -> Maintainer
            bob     -> Maintainer
            charlie -> Developer
            dave    -> Guest

        and a configured role mapping:

            Maintainer -> admin
            Developer  -> write
            Guest      -> read
            Auditor    -> read

        Unlike team-based strategies, no additional Forgejo teams are created:

            Forgejo Organization
                └── Owner Team (platform required)

        The following potential team structure is intentionally NOT created:

            forgejo-maintainers
            forgejo-developers
            forgejo-guests
            forgejo-auditors

        For repository "project-a", access is granted directly to users:

            project-a
                ├── alice   (admin)
                ├── bob     (admin)
                ├── charlie (write)
                └── dave    (read)

        Even if an access level exists in configuration but has no users:

            Auditor -> read

        no Forgejo team is created and no repository team assignment is made.

        Behaviour:
        - Does not create access-level Forgejo teams.
        - Does not manage team membership.
        - Does not attach teams to repositories.
        - Imports all repository accessors as direct collaborators.
        - Maps source access levels directly to Forgejo permissions.
        - Requires only the mandatory Forgejo owner team.
        - Ignores empty team definitions because no team modelling is performed.
        - Suitable for migrations where preserving repository access is important
        but reproducing the source-system team structure is not.
