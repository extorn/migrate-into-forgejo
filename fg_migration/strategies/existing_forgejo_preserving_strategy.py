class ExistingForgejoPreservingStrategy(AccessLevelAccessMappingStrategy):
    """
    Migration strategy that preserves all pre-existing Forgejo structures.

    This strategy creates new teams only when they do not already exist.
    Existing Forgejo teams are never modified, renamed, repurposed, or
    assumed to represent source-system groups.

    When a source group conflicts with an existing Forgejo team name, a
    new migration-specific team is created instead.

    Example
    -------
    Source-system groups:

        Maintainers
            ├── alice
            └── bob

        Developers
            └── charlie

        Guests
            └── dave

    Existing Forgejo organization:

        Maintainers
            └── legacy-user

    Because the existing team is preserved, the migration creates:

        Maintainers_migrated
            ├── alice
            └── bob

        Developers
            └── charlie

        Guests
            └── dave

    rather than modifying the existing Maintainers team.

    Repository access is then attached to the migration-created teams:

        project-a
            ├── Maintainers_migrated
            ├── Developers
            └── Guests

    Existing Forgejo teams remain untouched.

    Behaviour:
    - Never modifies existing Forgejo teams.
    - Never removes existing team members.
    - Never repurposes existing teams.
    - Creates migration-specific teams on naming conflict.
    - Preserves empty source groups as empty teams.
    - Grants repository access through migration-created teams.
    - Suitable for migrations into active Forgejo environments.
