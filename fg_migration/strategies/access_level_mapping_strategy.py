class AccessLevelAccessMappingStrategy(BaseAccessMappingStrategy):
    """
    Access mapping strategy that derives Forgejo teams and repository permissions
    directly from source-system access levels.

    This strategy treats access levels as the canonical representation of
    authorization. Users with the same source access level are grouped into a
    corresponding Forgejo team, and repository access is granted through those
    teams whenever possible.

    Example
    -------
    Source system organization memberships:

        alice   -> Maintainer
        bob     -> Maintainer
        charlie -> Developer
        dave    -> Guest

    Team mappings:

        Maintainer -> forgejo-maintainers
        Developer  -> forgejo-developers
        Guest      -> forgejo-guests
        Auditor    -> forgejo-auditors

    Resulting Forgejo organization structure:

        forgejo-maintainers
            ├── alice
            └── bob

        forgejo-developers
            └── charlie

        forgejo-guests
            └── dave

        forgejo-auditors
            └── <no members>

    The empty "forgejo-auditors" team may still be created when
    ADD_EMPTY_TEAMS_TO_ORGANIZATIONS is enabled and the team definition
    allows empty teams.

    Repository access example
    -------------------------
    If repository "project-a" is accessible to all four users in the source
    system, the strategy will preferentially grant repository access through
    teams:

        project-a
            ├── forgejo-maintainers
            ├── forgejo-developers
            └── forgejo-guests

    rather than creating individual repository collaborators.

    Empty teams can also be attached to repositories when
    ADD_EMPTY_TEAMS_TO_REPOSITORIES is enabled:

        project-a
            ├── forgejo-maintainers
            ├── forgejo-developers
            ├── forgejo-guests
            └── forgejo-auditors (0 members)

    This allows predefined permission structures to exist in Forgejo even when
    no users currently occupy a given role.

    Direct collaborators are only used as a fallback when a user cannot be
    represented through a team-based access mapping.

    Behaviour:
    - Creates or reuses Forgejo teams mapped from source access levels.
    - Optionally creates configured empty teams even when no source users map
      to them.
    - Imports organization membership by assigning users to the appropriate
      access-level team.
    - Grants repository access through teams for organization-owned repositories.
    - Optionally grants repository access to empty teams.
    - Falls back to direct repository collaborators only for users not covered
      by team-based access.
    - Supports fuzzy role/team mapping when enabled by migration configuration.
    - Preserves team-based authorization intent by avoiding automatic conversion
      of failed team assignments into individual collaborator assignments.
